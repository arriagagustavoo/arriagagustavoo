# I'm Gustavo Arriaga, an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Houston.

I want to learn and build projects with every field Computer Science has to offer.
As of now, I have made notable projects through required course work, but those made me eager to use what I learned to make my own projects going forward.
Through recent courses taken, I have developed a real interest with how game development works, digital imaging in the medical scene and Full-Stack Web Development.
I also like to mess around with CAD(Autodesk Fusion) and develop my own custom 3D models to print.

I am excited to pick up more skills as time goes on.
