# Hi, I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Houston.

I want to learn and build projects with every field Computer Science has to offer.
As of now, I have made notable projects through required course work, but those made me eager to use what I learned to make my own projects going forward.
Through recent courses taken, I have developed a real interest with how game development works, digital imaging works in the medical scene and a more hands on experience with Full-Stack Web Development.

## Notable courses taken:

Data Structures & Algorithms, Database Systems, Discrete Math, Linear Algebra, 
Computer Graphics*, Programming Paradigms, Medical Imaging**

###### *used python's openGL pygame library
###### **used MATLAB image processing toolbox

I am excited to pick up more skills as time goes on.
